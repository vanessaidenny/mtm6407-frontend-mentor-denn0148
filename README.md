## Activity Description

### Objective
Practice layout skills by choosing and completing a challenge from Frontend Mentor, using the provided files and design documents to create a responsive web page that closely matches the provided mockups.

### Requirements
- [] Web page should be responsive and optimized to work on multiple screen sizes. 
- [X] Use a modern CSS Framework like Bootstrap or Foundation.
- [] Use a JavaScript library or framework.  
- [] The finished web page must closely match the provided mockups.


## Challenge Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
